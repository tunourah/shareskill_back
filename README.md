## üõ†Ô∏è ShareSkill - Backend

### üìù Brief Description
This is the backend for the Local Services Marketplace application. It handles the server-side logic, API endpoints, database interactions, and authentication for the platform. This part of the project provides the data and services needed by the frontend.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About This README
This README file provides an overview of the backend application, including the technologies used, database schema (ERD), API routes, and installation instructions. Its purpose is to guide developers in setting up, understanding, and contributing to the backend codebase.

### üó∫Ô∏è Planning Materials
Key planning aspects related to the backend include:
*   User authentication (registration, login, logout).
*   API endpoints for managing service categories, listings, requests, and reviews.
*   Database design to support core functionalities and relationships.
*   Ensuring secure and efficient data handling.
 

### üíª Technologies Used
*   **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
*   **Django REST Framework**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.
*   **SQL (PostgreSQL/SQLite)**: Database management system (PostgreSQL for production, SQLite for development).
 

 
### üìä ERD Diagram

**Note:** The `USER` model here represents a general user. The distinction between 'Client' and 'Provider' roles can be managed via a field within the USER model (e.g., `user_type`) or through relationships if more complex role-based permissions are needed beyond what Django's built-in groups/permissions offer. The relationships shown (e.g., `USER provides SERVICELISTING`) imply the USER in that context is a Provider. Similarly, `USER requests SERVICEREQUEST` implies the USER is a Client.

**Models Overview:**
*   **User (Django Auth)**: Manages user accounts and authentication.
*   **Category**: Defines types of services offered.
*   **ServiceListing**: Represents a specific service offered by a Provider.
*   **ServiceRequest**: Represents a Client's request for a service.
*   **Review**: Allows Clients to review completed services.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions
To get the backend development environment running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
     (https://github.com/tunourah/shareskill_back)
    ```
 
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up the database:**
    *   For SQLite (development): No further setup usually needed, Django will create the file.
    *   For PostgreSQL (production): Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. Create a database and user, then update `settings.py` with your database credentials.
    ```python
    # Example DATABASES setting in settings.py for PostgreSQL
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
            'NAME': 'your_db_name',
            'USER': 'your_db_user',
            'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432',
        }
    }
    ```
5.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
6.  **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
7.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The API should now be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### üöÄ Running the Application
*   Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
*   Run `python manage.py runserver`.

### üß™ Running Tests
